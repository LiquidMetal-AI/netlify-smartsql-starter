     * Stores a new memory entry in the agent's working memory. Memories are organized
     * by timeline and can include contextual information like the agent responsible
     * and triggering events.
     *
     * The system will:
     *
     * - Store the memory with automatic timestamping
     * - Generate embeddings for semantic search
     * - Associate the memory with the specified timeline
     * - Enable future retrieval and search operations
     *
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * const putMemory = await client.putMemory.create({
     *   content: 'User prefers dark theme for the interface',
     *   sessionId: '01jxanr45haeswhay4n0q8340y',
     *   smartMemoryLocation: {
     *     smartMemory: {
     *       name: 'memory-name',
     *       application_name: 'demo',
     *       version: '1234',

     *   },
